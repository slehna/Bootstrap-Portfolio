            Hi i'm a cycling/ boxing addict with a huge love for baked goods. if i'm not drowaway doing homework or dreding my junior year at UCSD; you'll usually find me either shoping
            or doing someone's makeup.I am basically an extrovert person and so I make friends very easily.
            I have so many friends and we all enjoy a lot. I visit their
            homes and they also visit my home. I also like drawing and painting and playing outdoor games like
            volleyball and badminton.
            At school we have the coaching for these and so it makes it easy for me to learn well, these sport
            activities. 
          </p>

        love fashion social media and makeup. started juicing for the health benefits, and really into skin care.
        During my free time I draw pictures and paint them. I have done three four paintings that have been put up at my home.

        Apart from these activities, I also like reading and cooking and so I read a lot of books. Detective novels
        are what I
        like the best now and have a great collection on them. Cooking is something I enjoy and so I watch my Mom
        make dishes
        and also help her and sometimes give a try in making them.
